        <h2>ROLE OF VIDEOS</h2>
        <p>Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video you want to add. </br>You can also type a keyword to search online for the video that best fits your document.</p>
        <h2>PAGE DESIGNS</h2>
        <p>To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides <b>header, footer, cover page,</b> and <b>text box</b> designs that complement each other.</br> For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.</p>
        <h2>THEMES</h2> 
        <p>Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. </br>When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. </br>When you apply styles, your headings change to match the new theme.</p>
        <img src = "C:\Users\asare\Documents\html\pictures\download.jpg" height = "250" width = "500">
        <h2>CONVENIENCE BUTTONS</h2>
        <p>Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them.<br> To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it.</br>When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.</p>
        <h2>READING TOOLS</h2>
        <p>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus on the text you want. </br>If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.</p>
